# Paint
Ciphense(AI/ML Company) Mini Project

The Project is used to draw lines, geometrical shapes along with colors.

You need to run the file with a server(Visual Studio Code Terminal) or in a browser(other than Chrome). 

# Running in Visual Studio Code

First you should have node js installed in your system and then install live server in the editor. 

# Installing live server 

Open new terminal by clicking <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd>

Then type the below command in the terminal to install live server.
```bat 
npm install live-server -g
```


Then the editor redirects you to a browser opening the project.
